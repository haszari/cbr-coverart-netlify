# Cartoon Beats cover art utility

This is a React app to help me protoype and lay out cover art for [Cartoon Beats Reality](https://cartoonbeats.com/releases/) releases, and wrangle DJ mix playlist metadata for [posting radio shows online](https://cartoonbeats.com/beats-reality-radio/).

Also includes support for parsing Traktor NML (XML) files and converting to easily editable yaml file, which can then be input to a component that lays out a cover art grid image and tracklist.
